# Datasets & Variables

## The CAMELS-CL dataset

- Minimum Temperature
- Maximum Temperature
- Precipitation
- Ground Water Rights
- Surface Water Rights
- PET

These datasets have temporal data, beginning around 1980 and ending around 2020 (depending on the dataset)

*Note: The CAMELS-CL dataset does include streamflow data, but due to large amounts of missing data, it was not incorporated into the model*

## Extracted from Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery from GEE

- NDVI
- NDWI

## Variables not included

Several variables that are important for consideration when examining factors that determine overall health of a bofedal but do not have readily avalible datasets include:

- Bofedal management strategies
- Population dynamics in herding communities
- Carrying capacity of ganandos by species

Socioeconomic variables such as these are addressed later in the study through case studies and field work.
